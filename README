The option will be printed if you launch the program
without arguments :
$> ./visu 


Sources: (directory : src)
--------------------------
   main.c         : base program, call necessary function
   interpolate.c  : interpolation functions
   output.c       : write data to vtk files
   data.c         : generate data set, enventually read them from files
   types.h        : types used by the application

Test (directory : test):
------------------------
   In this directory you'll find the test files used to validate 
   and compare the methods we have implemented.

   Command use to run our test are in the file Commandes_test.txt 
   (executed from build)
